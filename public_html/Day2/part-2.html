        <h2>Bangladesh</h2>

        <p>
            Most of <b>Bangladesh is covered by the Bengal Delta,</b> the largest delta on Earth. The country has 700 rivers and <strong>8,046 km (5,000 mi)</strong> of inland waterways. Highlands with evergreen forests are found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of the country. Bangladesh has many islands and a coral reef. The longest unbroken sea beach of the world, Cox's Bazar Beach, is located in the southeast. It is home to the <i>Sundarbans</i>, the largest mangrove forest in the world. The country's <em>biodiversity</em> includes a vast array of plant and wildlife, including endangered Bengal tigers, the national animal.

            The <u title="Greaks">Greeks and Romans</u> identified <mark>the region as Gangaridai</mark>, a powerful kingdom of the historical Indian subcontinent, in the 3rd century BCE. Archaeological research has unearthed several ancient cities in Bangladesh, which enjoyed international trade links for <del>millennia.[15]</del> <ins>The </ins>Bengal Sultanate and Mughal Bengal transformed the region into a cosmopolitan Islamic imperial power between the 14th and 18th centuries. The region was home to many principalities that made use of their inland naval prowess.<sup>[16][17]</sup> <sub>It was also a notable center</sub> of the global muslin and silk trade. As part of British India, the region was influenced by the Bengali renaissance and played an important role in anti-colonial movements. The Partition of British India made East Bengal a part of the Dominion of Pakistan; and renamed it as East Pakistan. The region witnessed the Bengali Language Movement in 1952 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.[18] After independence was achieved, a parliamentary republic was established. A presidential government was in place between 1975 and 1990, followed by a return to parliamentary democracy. The country continues to face challenges in the areas of poverty, <small>education</small>, healthcare and corruption.<b>Bold Tag</b><strong>Strong tag</strong><i>Italic Tag</i><em>Emphasize Text</em><u>Underline Tag</u><del>Delete Tag</del><ins>Insert Tag</ins><sub>Subscript Tag</sub><sup>Superscript Tag</sup> <small>Small  Tag</small>
